Name: Valorant (game)
 
Feature Request :
The feature that I personally want in this game is that the user can choose if they want to paly solo or in duo or in squad or 5 players but these flexibility is not there in the game they have to compulsory play in 5 players squad which is quite frustration for me when there is one only friend of my mine who is online or in some of the time when there is no one online to paly with me. So they should add the option in which the user can select the number of players they want in their team the maximum number of players should be five but they should consider minimum number of players also and should develop the game and opponent according to option selected my the user.
There are also so many players like me who want the same feature as they do not want to play with randoms when their friends are offline as their rank can decrease if they paly with randoms.
