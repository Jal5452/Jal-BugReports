**Describe the bug**
when you open the fido webiste on your laptop or pc and then go to sign in option and when you copy the URL of that sign in page of fido and then sent it to someone and then ask them to open the URL or when you try to access the link via the URL sent then you or that person will notice that when they are redirected to that page only the watermark of the fido sign page will appear with a blank white rectangle instead of the sign in option 
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the fido website and then go to the sign option and copy the URL of the sign in page 
2. Then sent it to someone and ask them to open it or you try to open it 
3. When you or that person whom you sent the link try to open it and when redirected to page only the watermark of the page will appear with a blank white rectangle instead of sign in detail
4. If it does not work on the first go then try it after some time or do it 3 or 4 time then the bug will appear.
5. And then you can see the bug.

**Expected behavior**
I expected that when someone will try to access the URL of that page then they will be redirected to the sign in page of the fido website.
