Name: Splitwise (Application)

Feature Request:
The feature that I want in the splitwise application is that they should add and option to send the money directly via the app to the person whom the money is owed as the purpose of the application is that it equally divides the money amongst the people it is set in between which is very easy for everyone to keep track of the money they owe but if one can pay directly through the app then it will be very easy for the user to send the money and keep track of it. But they have to go their banking app and then pay the money and then again go back to the app and select the option "settle up" but if they add an option to pay via app then it would be very convenient for the user as well as it will be less time consuming.
There are many users who want this feature in the app as they face the same difficulty they make the payment and then they forgot to select the option "settle up" and the money keeps on adding but if they add the feature to pay via the app only then there will be no such issue.
